# lit - A Software Testing Tool

## About

*lit* is a portable tool for executing LLVM and Clang style test suites,
summarizing their results, and providing indication of failures.

This is a modified version of *lit* based on
[LLVM 16.0.4 Release](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-16.0.4).
Now we use it to grab report printed from those sanitizers.


## Documentation

The official *lit* documentation is available online at the LLVM
Command Guide: http://llvm.org/cmds/lit.html.


## Source

The *lit* source is available as part of LLVM, in the LLVM source repository:
https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/llvm/utils/lit
